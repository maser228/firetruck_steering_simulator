# firetruck_steering_simulator
PyGame-based app to simulate turning radius of long vehicles while navigating narrow areas.

Originally forked from pygame-car-tutorial by rasmaxim then modified beyond recognition so all credit and no blame to them.

The purpose of this super-basic 2D app is to illustrate turning effects of long-wheelbase vehicles like fire trucks.
As the truck moves, the paths of the front and rear tires and turning radius are shown in real time.

Keyboard controls:
- Up/Down Arrows -- increase/decrease speed
- Left/Right -- adjust steering angle
- Spacebar -- stop

The first few lines of game.py show how to add your own map images.
